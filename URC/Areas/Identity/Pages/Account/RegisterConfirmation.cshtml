            This app does not currently have a real email sender registered, see <a href="https://aka.ms/aspaccountconf">these docs</a> for how to configure a real email sender.
            Normally this would be emailed: <a id="confirm-link" href="@Model.EmailConfirmationUrl">Click here to confirm your account</a>
        </p>
